# UniversalAWGBIN
Universal format for binary waveforms for arbitrary waveform generators which overcomes the limitations of the WAV format being 4 GB file size/4G samples/4G sampling rate and cannot store voltage parameters.

This project is currently in the planning stage and is awaiting input from potential users - refer to FileFormat.txt for details.
